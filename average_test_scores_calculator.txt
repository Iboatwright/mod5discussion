Lab 6.4 - Average Test Scores
-----------------------------
Write a program that will allow a teacher to calculate the average test
score for a certain number of students.  The teacher can enter the
number of students who took the test, and then the score for each
student.  Your program will then calculate the average score and print
out the results.  Your program must use the appropriate loop, modules,
and run multiple times for different sets of test scores.

Your sample output might look as follows:

    How many students took the test: 9
    Enter their score: 98
    Enter their score: 78
    Enter their score: 99
    Enter their score: 92
    Enter their score: 87
    Enter their score: 100
    Enter their score: 88
    Enter their score: 81
    Enter their score: 79
    The average test score is 89
    Do you want to end program? (Enter no to process a new set of scores): yes

                           score, number, counter)
